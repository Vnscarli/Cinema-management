#Django API for managing a cinema
##This project was created to apply my knowledge in Django to a project done in a week

It involvees creating a simple API in Django to manage Rooms and Movies in a cinema. The room can have multiple movies and a movie is able to be in the database without necessarily having a room to be displayed.

The project uses Postgres as database and Django Rest Framework for the API. It also uses Swagger to describe the structure of the API.
